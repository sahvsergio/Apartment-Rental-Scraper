# Apartment Rental Scraper

The apartment Rental Scraper visits a real state agency, looks for apartments/houses located in a predetermined location and at a certain place, after that , it takes the information, dumps it into a file and then sends an email report for updated locations available at the set price.

I am using the following tools:

- Python 3.11.6:It is the programming language that I am most familiar with
- Selenium: As the site has a robots.txt file which wouldn't allow me to scrape it using beautiful soup or requests.
- Pandas: In order to handle the data extracted from the site.
